        		<h1>Hello there, I am Thomas Köntges</h1>
				<p> I am an Akademischer Assistent (AE: Assistant Professor, BE: Lecturer) at the Alexander-von-Humboldt-Chair for Digital Humanities at the Institute for Computer Science and Mathematics, University of Leipzig, but I am also a trained Classicist.</p>
				<p>My main research interests are: digital humanities, in particular topic-modelling, digital stemmatology, the production of digital editions, and citizen science; and Classics, in particular satire, textual criticism, and textual transmission of classical authors. I intend to reconstruct and research ancient texts employing e- teaching and citizen science tools and to collaborate with classicists, medieval historians, librarians, and IT experts, and then to share this knowledge openly with students at all levels, independent of their language skills.</p>
				<p>Recently, I have applied machine-learning to the textual transmission of classical authors and have been the lead in the Historical Languages ELearning Project (HLEP) at the University of Leipzig, in which we developed a new distance-learning environment for historical languages. I am continuing to research Petronian manuscripts (my Ph.D. had a text-critical focus): one of my main responsibilities in the Open Greek and Latin Project is to study the textual transmission of Petronius and to negotiate the digitisation of not-yet-digitised Petronian material, so it can be catalogued and used for further research.</p>
				<p>I have also been working on new methods of social network analysis, topic-modelling, and applied machine- learning within the digital Colenso Project in Wellington. My topic-modelling processes, originally crafted during my involvement with the Colenso Project and my research of Latin literature, have since been applied to other languages, for instance Ancient Greek and Arabic, and used within the GLAM sector. I wish to extend the applicability to more languages and fields in the future.</p>
